# Changelog

Changes to the widget collection. Each widget also has its own `version` in its widget.yaml.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `shelly` (1.0.2): no `update` block when the device is up to date, so the card shows only the
  firmware version; the block (marked) appears when an update is available or being installed.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-10-31

### Changed
- `shelly` (1.0.1): a refused password (401) says so on the card ("The password was refused –
  check "password""), or asks for `password` when none is set, with the raw error below it,
  instead of only "Shelly Shelly.CheckForUpdate answered 401".

## [0.8.0] - 2026-10-30

### Added
- `shelly` (1.0.0): a Shelly device's firmware version and an available update (marked), with an
  **Update firmware** button that starts it through the widget API's `action` call. Gen2, Gen3
  and Gen4 over the RPC API (digest auth as `admin`), Gen1 over `/shelly` and `/ota` (basic auth);
  `beta: true` also offers beta firmware. Needs dashboard 0.10.0 or newer for the button's quiet
  success (0.8.0 or newer for the button).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-10-25

### Changed
- `button` (1.2.0): a spinner instead of the label while the run lasts; a successful run shows a
  check for a moment and no dialog, a failed one opens the result dialog. Needs dashboard 0.10.0
  or newer for the quiet success (an older one shows the dialog every time).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added
- `button` (1.1.0): `user: root` runs the script as root in the dashboard container, for files
  that must stay owned by root. Needs dashboard 0.9.0 or newer with `HD_ALLOW_ROOT_SCRIPTS=true`;
  without it the button says so.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-10-25

### Added
- `button` (1.0.0): a full-width button on a card or in the header that opens a link (`href`), or
  runs a bash script (`script`, relative to the config folder) or a shell command (`command`) on
  the dashboard's server through the widget API's new `action` call. The run gets only `PATH` and
  `HOME` unless `inheritEnv: true`, is stopped with everything it started after `timeout` seconds
  (default 300), and returns the last 64 kB of output and the exit code. Needs a dashboard with
  `action` support (0.8.0 or newer).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-25

### Added
- `docker` (1.4.0): `rx` and `tx`, the data received and sent over the container's networks, as
  homepage's RX and TX next to CPU and memory.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-25

The dashboard's built-in widgets moved here, so every widget is now in this collection; the
dashboard's next release needs this one.

### Added
- `http-status`, `ping`, `docker`, `kubernetes-pods` and `proxmoxvm`: the widgets behind a
  service's `siteMonitor:`, `ping:`, `container:`, `app:` and `proxmoxNode:`, moved here from the
  dashboard with the same options.
- `custom-api` (also `customapi`), `iframe`, `kubernetes`, and the header widgets `datetime`,
  `greeting`, `logo`, `resources` and `search`, moved here from the dashboard with the same
  options. The dashboard's built-in copies win over these until its next release.

### Changed
- `kubernetes-pods` has its own copy of the Kubernetes connection code instead of importing it
  from `kubernetes`, so the folder can be installed on its own.
- `resources`: shorter French and Croatian labels for CPU temperature and uptime, without
  abbreviations.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-25

Every service widget of homepage now has a counterpart here (or built into the dashboard): about
150 new widgets, each in the dashboard's 17 languages. openmeteo, openweathermap and stocks moved
here from the dashboard; this release is needed by dashboard 0.5.0.

### Added
- `glances`: CPU, memory, CPU temperature, uptime and disks from Glances (API 3 or 4), as
  homepage's glances info widget.
- `longhorn`: storage used in total and per node from the Longhorn API, with `provider: longhorn`,
  as homepage's longhorn info widget.

  Network controller, with an API key or a local account (UniFi OS or classic), as in homepage.

  widgets: they talk to an outside service. Same options, plus `url` (another API server, e.g.
  your own Open-Meteo). A stock's block label is its symbol through `vars`. The dashboard keeps
  its built-in copies until its next release, and those win over these meanwhile.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-24

### Added
- A `README.md` per widget with the setup in the service, every field and an example. It is the
  widget's page on the [documentation site](https://stefanrenne.github.io/homelab-dashboard/widgets/collection/).

### Changed
- The dashboard installs this collection by default (`#latest`); list it in `settings.yaml` only
  to pin a release or use `only:`. No widget code changed, so the widget versions stay the same.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-24

### Added
- Twelve widgets with homepage's field names: radarr, sonarr, bazarr, prowlarr, sabnzbd, seerr,
  stash, tautulli, tdarr, whatsupdocker, portainer and unraid.
- Queues that lead with problems and stop at `queueLimit` with "+N more"; counts that need
  attention marked; labels that fit a phone in five languages; decimal units and one time format.
- Validated against live services (all but tdarr and whatsupdocker).
