# qui

The torrents downloading and seeding (active of all) with the download and upload rates across
all qBittorrent instances that qui manages, or with `instance` one of them, as homepage's qui
widget. `fields` also offers the total, the errored torrents (marked) and, for one instance, the
share ratio and free disk space. Create a key under **Settings > API Keys** and use it as `key`;
an instance's ID is shown in qui.
