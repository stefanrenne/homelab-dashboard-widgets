# Grafana

Dashboards, data sources, alert rules and the alerts that are firing (marked), as homepage's
grafana widget. Set `version: 2` for Grafana after 10.4; it then reads the alerts from Grafana's
own alertmanager, or with `alerts: alertmanager` from an external Alertmanager set up as a data
source.

The counts come from `/api/admin/stats`, so `username` and `password` are those of a Grafana
server admin.
