# Vikunja

Your projects in Vikunja and the open tasks due within a week, overdue (marked) and in progress,
as homepage's vikunja widget. `enableTaskList: true` adds the next five tasks by due date as rows.
Create a token under **Settings > API Tokens** with read access to projects and tasks, and use
it as `key`. For Vikunja 1.0.0-rc4 and later set `version: 2`.
