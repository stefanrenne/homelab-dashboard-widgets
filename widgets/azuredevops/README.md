# Azure DevOps

The latest run of a pipeline (its result, failed marked, or its status while it runs) and, for a
repository, the open pull requests: all, yours, and yours that someone approved, as homepage's
azuredevops widget. Give `definitionId` for the pipeline (it is in the pipeline's address),
`repositoryId` and `userEmail` for the pull requests, or both.

Make a personal access token under **User settings > Personal access tokens > New Token** with
**Build: Read** and **Code: Read**.
