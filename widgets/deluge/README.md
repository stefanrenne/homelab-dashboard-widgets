# Deluge

Torrents that are still downloading (leech) and complete (seed), with the total download and
upload rate, as homepage's deluge widget. With `enableLeechProgress: true` the downloads follow
one per row with their progress and time left, errored ones first and marked, up to
`queueLimit` and "+N more".

`password` is the Web UI password (**Preferences > Interface > Password**). The Web UI must be
connected to a daemon (**Connection Manager**).
