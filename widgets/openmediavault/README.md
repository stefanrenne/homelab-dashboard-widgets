- `services.getStatus`: services running, stopped (marked) and in total.
- `smart.getListBg`: disks whose S.M.A.R.T. check passed and failed (marked); only disks with
  monitoring on count.
- `downloader.getDownloadList`: downloads of the Downloader plugin in progress and in total.

`username` and `password` are a web interface login (the `admin` user, or a user in the
