# Gluetun

The public IP address the VPN gives you, with its region and country, and with `fields` the
forwarded port, as homepage's gluetun widget. It reads Gluetun's
[control server](https://github.com/qdm12/gluetun-wiki/blob/main/setup/advanced/control-server.md)
(port 8000). With the control server's API key authentication, put the key in `key` and allow
the route `GET /v1/publicip/ip` for it in Gluetun's `config.toml`, and for the forwarded port
`GET /v1/openvpn/portforwarded` (or `GET /v1/portforward` from Gluetun 3.40.1, with `version: 2`).
