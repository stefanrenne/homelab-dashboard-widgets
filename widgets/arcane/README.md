# Arcane

Containers running, stopped and in total, and images with an update (marked), as homepage's
arcane widget; the number of images, used and unused through `fields`. Make an API key in
Arcane with the permissions `containers:list`, `images:list` and `image-updates:read`. `env` is
the environment id (0 is the local one).
