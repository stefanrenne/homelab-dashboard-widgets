# CoinMarketCap

One row per cryptocurrency you list, with its price and its change over `defaultinterval` (1h,
24h, 7d or 30d), as homepage's coinmarketcap widget. List `symbols` (BTC, ETH) or, since symbols
are not unique, `slugs` (bitcoin, chia-network); slugs win. Get an API key on the
[CoinMarketCap Pro dashboard](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/account).
