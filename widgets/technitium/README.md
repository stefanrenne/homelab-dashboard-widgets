# Technitium DNS Server

The queries a Technitium DNS server answered over the past `range` (default the last hour), and
how many of them were authoritative, cached and server failures (marked), each with its share,
as homepage's technitium widget. `fields` also offers no error, NX domain, refused, recursive,
blocked, dropped and the clients. Create an API token (best for a user of its own) under
**Administration > Sessions > Create Token**. `node` picks a cluster node, or `cluster` for all
of them.
