# UniFi Drive

The total, used (above 90% marked) and free space of a UniFi NAS (UNAS) and the state of its
storage pools (degraded marked), as homepage's unifi_drive widget (`type: unifi_drive` works too). Create a local UniFi account
with read access for the dashboard (**UniFi OS > Admins & Users**, Restrict to local access only).
`insecure: true` accepts the device's self-signed certificate.
