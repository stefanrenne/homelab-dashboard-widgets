# QNAP

A QNAP NAS's CPU and memory use, its temperature, and the use of all its volumes together, or
with `volume` of one volume (named as in **Storage & Snapshots**), as homepage's qnap widget.
CPU, memory and volume use above 90% are marked. The widget logs in with a QTS user; two-step
verification must be off for that user. `insecure: true` accepts the NAS's self-signed
certificate.
