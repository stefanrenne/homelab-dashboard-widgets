# wg-easy

The WireGuard clients in wg-easy that are connected (a handshake within `threshold` minutes,
default 2), enabled and in total, and with `fields` the disabled ones, as homepage's wgeasy
widget. Before wg-easy 15 only the web interface's `password` is needed; from 15 set
`version: 2` and fill in `username` too.
