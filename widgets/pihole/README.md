# Pi-hole

Today's DNS queries, how many were blocked (also as a share) and the number of domains on the
blocklist (gravity), as homepage's pihole widget.

Set `version: 6` for Pi-hole 6 or later (homepage's default is 5). With Pi-hole 6, `key` is the
web interface password or an app password (**Settings > Web interface / API > Configure app
password**); leave it out when Pi-hole has no password. With Pi-hole 5, `key` is the API token
from **Settings > API / Web interface > Show API token**.
