# Zabbix

The problems in Zabbix (monitored triggers in a problem state) per severity: warning and average
(marked as warnings), high and disaster (marked as errors), and with `fields` unclassified and
information, as homepage's zabbix widget. Needs Zabbix 7 or later. Create a token under **Users >
API tokens** and use it as `key`; `url` is the front end's address (often ending in `/zabbix`).
