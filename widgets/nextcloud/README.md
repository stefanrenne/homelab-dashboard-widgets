# Nextcloud

Free disk space, users active in the last 24 hours, the number of files and the number of shares,
as homepage's nextcloud widget. homepage's older `cpuload` (the load average) and `memoryusage`
are there too: pick them with `fields`.

Use the token from **Administration settings > System** (at the bottom, "Monitoring endpoint
with token") as `key`, or an admin's `username` with an app password from **Personal settings >
Security**. The serverinfo app must be enabled (it is by default).
