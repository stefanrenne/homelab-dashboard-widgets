# MikroTik

A MikroTik router's uptime, CPU load and memory used (above 90% marked) and its DHCP leases, as
homepage's mikrotik widget. It uses the REST API of RouterOS 7; turn on the `www-ssl` service
(**IP > Services**), since RouterOS only offers the REST API over https on most setups, and
`insecure: true` accepts the router's self-signed certificate. A read-only user is enough.
