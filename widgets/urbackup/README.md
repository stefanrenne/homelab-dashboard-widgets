# UrBackup

The clients whose backups are fine, failed (marked) or not recent (marked), and with `fields`
the space all backups take, as homepage's urbackup widget. A client is fine when its file backup,
and its image backup when it makes those, ran within `maxDays` (default 3) without errors. The
widget logs in with a user of UrBackup's web interface (or anonymously without one); it sees the
clients that user may see.
