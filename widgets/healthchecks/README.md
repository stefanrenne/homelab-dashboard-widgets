# Health checks

The checks that are up and down (marked) in a Healthchecks.io project, or with `uuid` one
check's state (down and in its grace period marked) and how long ago it last pinged, as
homepage's healthchecks widget. Create a key in your project under **Settings > API Access >
Create API key** (read-only is enough) and use it as `key`. Works with a self-hosted
Healthchecks and with healthchecks.io.
