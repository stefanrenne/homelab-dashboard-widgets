Torrents that are still downloading (leech) and complete (seed), with the total download and
upload rate, as homepage's transmission widget. Give `username` and `password` when Transmission
has RPC authentication on (`rpc-authentication-required`). Change `rpcUrl` only when
Transmission's `rpc-url` is not `/transmission/`.
