# Emby

What is playing on Emby, one row per stream with its position and a progress bar (paused
streams get a pause icon), as homepage's emby widget. With `enableBlocks: true` it also shows
the number of movies, series, episodes and songs; `enableNowPlaying: false` leaves the
streams out. Pausing a stream from the card (homepage's `enableMediaControl`) is not offered:
the widgets only read.

Make an API key in Emby under **Settings > Advanced > API Keys**.
