# JDownloader

The packages in JDownloader's download list, their total size, what is left to download and the
download rate, as homepage's jdownloader widget. Like homepage it goes through
[My.JDownloader](https://my.jdownloader.org/): connect JDownloader to your account under
**Settings > My.JDownloader**, then fill in the account's e-mail address and password and the
device name shown there as `client`. JDownloader needs no open port for this.
