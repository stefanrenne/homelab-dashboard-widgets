# Tracearr

The streams playing now across your Plex, Jellyfin and Emby servers, from Tracearr: a row per
stream with its title, play or pause and its progress, as homepage's tracearr widget.
`view: summary` shows the streams, transcodes, direct plays and the total bitrate instead, and
`view: both` both. `enableUser` adds the user, `showEpisodeNumber` the season and episode. Create
a public API key under **Settings > API** and use it as `key`.
