# ntfy

The latest notification of an ntfy topic: its title, message, priority (high marked, urgent as an
error), how long ago it came, and with `fields` its tags, as homepage's ntfy widget. Works with a
self-hosted ntfy and with ntfy.sh. For a protected topic give an access token (`tk_...`) as
`key`, or a `username` and `password`.
