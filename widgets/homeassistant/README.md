# Home Assistant

People at home, lights that are on and switches that are on (each as "on / all"), as homepage's
homeassistant widget. With `custom`, up to four entries of your own instead, in homepage's form:

- `state: <entity_id>` shows that entity. `label` defaults to `{attributes.friendly_name}`, `value`
  to `{state} {attributes.unit_of_measurement}`; both may name other attributes in braces.
- `template: <Jinja template>` shows what Home Assistant renders, with your `label`.

Make a long-lived access token in Home Assistant: your profile (bottom left) > **Security** >
